# CarSome Booking

Developed a simple booking application for carsome.

## Development server / Installation

npm install  
ng serve or npm start 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/booking`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The application uses the API URL `http://localhost:3004/`, So make sure to run the server in code/api first.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
